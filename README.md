# Web Dock
#### A navigation dock for your website, inspired by Apple's OS X Yosemite dock.

##### My Observation:
The majority of websites feature a standard
navigation bar fixed to the top of the page.
Observing this made me think about whether
this was the best form of website navigation,
and being that I use my macbook everyday,
I wondered why desktops use a bottom dock
but websites never do. 

##### Why I built this:
I decided to make this dock as an experiment 
to see how a apple-esque dock would work
on a webpage, and hopefully get better
at vanilla javascript and css in the process.

##### Conclusion:
As of now, I don't really see it being better,
or really having many use-cases at all.
If you find one, please let me know!
