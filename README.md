# Web Dock
#### A navigation dock for your website, 
#### inspired by Apple's OS X Yosemite dock.

The majority of websites feature a standard
navigation bar fixed to the top of the page.
Observing this made me think about whether
this was the best form of website navigation,
and being that I use my macbook everyday,
I wondered why desktops don't use a navigation
at the top of a page, but rather the bottom. 

I built this web dock as an experiment to
not only get better at javascript and css,
but to see how a apple-esque dock would work
on a webpage. 

As of now, I don't really see it being better,
or really having many use-cases at all.
If you find one, please let me know!
